      <description>&lt;p&gt;The end as come for Hacktoberfest and I have bad news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t complete any pull request during the month of October like the challenge demanded. I need not use any excuse, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t complete the challenge sadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel sad for not completing the challenge but at the same time, I feel glad that I tried to complete it. Sometimes life gets in the way and the things we plan simply aren&amp;rsquo;t possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very much excited to complete it but couldn&amp;rsquo;t. I won&amp;rsquo;t give up though - next year I&amp;rsquo;ll be there again to face the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/&#34;&gt;9839&lt;/a&gt; who succesfuly completed the challenge but above all I&amp;rsquo;m glad that more than 88000 pull requests were opened in 28366 repositories which I&amp;rsquo;m sure is very interesting for the OSS community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that a lot of newcomers have joined the OSS community like I wish to do and that the projects that accepted the challenge and contributions are now better than they were before.&lt;/p&gt;
