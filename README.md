# hugomartins.io

This is the source code for my personal website that is currently hosted @ [hugomartins.io](http://hugomartins.io).

I have the website hosted on Github Pages and as such I also use the repo [caramelomartins.github.io](https://github.com/caramelomartins/caramelomartins.github.io) as a hosting system. For such a solution I usually deploy from this repository into the other repository.

I didn't want to have to manage separate branches and git subtrees to do this and wanted to be able to maintain a normal workflow for managing this project. For that I add the necessity to add a separate repository thus this one.

## Structure

This project uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator for compiling the source code into the artifacts that are present in the [caramelomartins.github.io](https://github.com/caramelomartins/caramelomartins.github.io) repository.
