[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/caramelomartins/hugomartins.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caramelomartins/hugomartins.io) [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/fdb84d27-ff75-4281-a176-b6054ae5de2d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hugomartins/deploys)

This is the source code for my personal website that is currently hosted @ [hugomartins.io](http://hugomartins.io). The website's design is a custom theme I made for Hugo and it is currently being built and hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Structure

This project uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator for compiling the source code into the artifacts. Most of this is based on Hugo's predefined structure:

- `content` - handles all the fixed and dynamic content.
- `static` - stores static assets.
- `themes` - stores the themes used in the website as git submodules.
