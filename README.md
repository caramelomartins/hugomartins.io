# hugomartins.io

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/caramelomartins/hugomartins.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caramelomartins/hugomartins.io)

This is the source code for my personal website that is currently hosted @ [hugomartins.io](http://hugomartins.io). The website's design is [Hugo Flex](https://github.com/de-souza/hugo-flex/) and it is currently being built and hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Structure

This project uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator for compiling the source code into the artifacts. Most of this is based on Hugo's predefined structure:

- `content` - handles all the fixed and dynamic content.
- `static` - stores static assets.
- `themes` - stores the themes used in the website as git submodules.

## License

For any source code that I have customly built [MIT](LICENSE). Anything related to the theme of the site is [Apache-2.0](https://github.com/de-souza/hugo-flex/blob/master/LICENSE).
