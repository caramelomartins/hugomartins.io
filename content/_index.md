I like to build and break things. Currently working on tools that improve developerâ€™s lives and productivity. Lately, I've grown an interest in reliability and scalability of distributed systems. These days I write Go, previously wrote Python and Kotlin.

I try to use this page for sharing whatever I am interested in or learning. Here you can also know more [about me](/about/), what [projects](/code/) I am working on or have a look at my [past research](/research/).
