summary: "An update on a previous essay I wrote about accessing host resources on Minikube which has now become outdated. Minikube now has improved on this and has a much better approach."

A few years ago, I wrote an essay about this topic titled "[How to Access Host Resources in Minikube Pods?]({{< ref "essays/2019/12/access-host-resources-minikube.md" >}})". In it, I have described how to access host resources in Minikube. Something I thought should be easy but, at the time, it really wasn't.

Back then, I've described an approach, based on a Github [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/2735), relying on listing kernel routing tables, that allowed us to fetch the IP of the host machine inside Minikube. I described why this worked, going so far as sharing a few snippets of code from the Kubernetes source code.

While this has served me well for the last few years, I've recently discovered that this approach is a bit outdated - the documentation on that essay doesn't even exist anymore. I wrote this when Minikube was v1.6.2 and it is now v1.23.1...a lot has happened.  After searching a bit more, I've understood that Minikube _now_ has a proper solution for this, documented in [Host access](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/host-access/).

This approach applies for Minikube bigger than v1.10 and it essentially relies on using `host.minikube.internal` in order to connect to the host Minikube is running on. According to the documentation, "minikube v1.10 adds a hostname entry host.minikube.internal to /etc/hosts." I've tested this and it seems to actually work, while being much easier and reliable.

As with the initial approach, the same caveat applies:

> The service running on your host must either be bound to all IPâ€™s (0.0.0.0) and interfaces, or to the IP and interface your VM is bridged against. If the service is bound only to localhost (127.0.0.1), this will not work.
