summary: "A few notes on the traffic this website has received between July and December 2022."

I’ve kept this tradition of looking back at the traffic every six months since 2021 ([here](https://hugomartins.io/essays/2022/07/traffic-january-june-2022/) and [here](https://hugomartins.io/essays/2022/01/traffic-july-december-2021/)). This time, it also marks the end of the year, in terms of traffic, which makes this review two-fold: a six-month review along with a yearly review.

![Stats](/images/Stats-July-December-2022)

In total, from July 2022 to December 2022, there were 11868 visitors and 13517 pageviews (~73/day). Google is still the biggest source of traffic, followed by Bing and DuckDuckGo. Compared with the previous month, visitors were down 10%, while pageviews were down 12%.

This isn’t a surprise to me in any way. I have written *only* two essays during this period and I didn’t share any of them broadly, I was actually quite surprised when I noticed the numbers didn’t go down even *more*.

The top essays have remained the same, throughout this semester, with only a slight change in ranking:

1. [How To Pass Multiple Parameters To Same Value in Query Strings](https://hugomartins.io/essays/2021/02/how-to-pass-multiple-values-to-http-query-parameter/)
2. [Building a Private Terraform Registry](https://hugomartins.io/essays/2021/01/build-a-terraform-private-registry/)
3. [Using require and check Functions in Kotlin](https://hugomartins.io/essays/2021/02/using-require-and-check-in-kotlin/)
4. [Understanding Differences Between List and MutableList in Kotlin](https://hugomartins.io/essays/2021/03/understanding-differences-between-list-and-mutablelist-in-kotlin/)
5. [How to Access Host Resources in Minikube Pods?](https://hugomartins.io/essays/2019/12/access-host-resources-minikube/)

[Using require and check Functions in Kotlin](https://hugomartins.io/essays/2021/02/using-require-and-check-in-kotlin/) surpassed both [How to Access Host Resources in Minikube Pods?](https://hugomartins.io/essays/2019/12/access-host-resources-minikube/) and [Understanding Differences Between List and MutableList in Kotlin](https://hugomartins.io/essays/2021/03/understanding-differences-between-list-and-mutablelist-in-kotlin/).

Throughout 2022, there were 24994 unique visitors and 28673 pageviews. Most of what was written in 2022 didn’t get much traction, except for [Essential Fields in Kubernetes Manifests](https://hugomartins.io/essays/2022/02/essential-fields-in-kubernetes-manifests/), which seems to have found its way to Top 10 somehow.

I didn’t share much (or anything) of what I wrote during the entire year, which is something I might want to change in 2023, but some of the things I wrote on the [journey to CKAD](https://hugomartins.io/series/ckad/) seemed to have resonated with people, even though I didn’t share them.

For 2023, I don’t want to necessarily increase traffic but I’d be happy if, *by writing and sharing more*, traffic would necessarily grow organically. I’ll put my focus more on the writing than I did in 2022, and we’ll see the impact doing that will have.
