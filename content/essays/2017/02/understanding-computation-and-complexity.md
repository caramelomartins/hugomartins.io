The theory of computation is a subject that has, since an early moment, caught my interest. I had a course during my Bachelor's study called "Computational Theory" and I liked it a lot.

I always liked to understand, with detail, how things work. How better to understand computers than to understand the roots behind how they work?

In that interest, and since I never actually got around to doing so, I'm reading [Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X) by Michael Sipser. I've been reading it for about two months, trying to absorb everything in it. Hey, I've been doing other things too!

Looking at the theorems. Looking at proofs of theorems. Looking at corollaries. This has given me a new perspective on the mathematics behind computation.

I hope I'll be able to follow this with other writings related to this topic.
