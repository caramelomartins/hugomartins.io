1. [Remote work created a cult of driven workers who wake up at 8:59 a.m.](https://fortune.com/2022/10/23/waking-up-one-minute-before-remote-job/). I wonder about this far more often that I'd admit. In seems that being a night owl, and working less in the morning, might actually have an impact in the perception others have of their peers.
2. [What “Work” Looks Like](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/what-work-looks-like/). "(...) sitting alone thinking doesn’t “look” like work. Even more so if it’s away from your computer." Nonetheless, sometimes this is really what is needed to be productive and achieve "work". This article is itself a thought on [The Case Against Collaboration](https://paulitaylor.com/2022/05/06/the-case-against-collaboration/), which I have not read.
3. [Professio sano in vitam sanam](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2022/10/21/professio-sano-in-vitam-sanam-on-balancing-work-and-life/). On how constraining the amount of hours worked in a week can improve the outputs and productivity of those hours that in which we work.
4. [Having impact in engineering by supporting other people's ideas](https://leaddev.com/technical-decision-making/having-impact-engineering-supporting-other-peoples-ideas). Insightful post by Tanya Reilly. "The real superpower is your ability to support other people's ideas and transform them from concepts into something that will actually work in reality."
