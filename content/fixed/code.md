Here is a list of some of the projects I have either created or worked on with other people. Also, there's a list of open source projects I have contributed to.

I have categorized them as best as it was possible for ease of understanding.

### Algorithms

[algorithms](https://github.com/caramelomartins/algorithms) is a repository that holds the implementation of some algorithms I have written along the way.

### Curation

[awesome-linters](https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters) is a curation of the best linting tools available for several programming languages. I takes inspiration from the Awesome lists [sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) has created.

[awesome-standards](https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-standards) is a curation of some interesting coding standards and convetions that are either used in projects or companies. This can be used as inspiration for when developing a specific new convention for a project.

### Configuration

[dotfiles](https://github.com/caramelomartins/dotfiles) are the .files, scripts and environment setup used in my Ubuntu machine.

### Documentation

[CFDocs](https://cfdocs.org/) is a repository that holds documentation for the ColdFusion Markup Language. Since I had the need to learn the language I have contributed with some documents to the project.

[Rocket.Chat.Docs](https://rocket.chat/docs/) is the documentation for the [Rocket.Chat's](https://rocket.chat/) API. While investigating their API I was able to contribute back some patches for the documentation website.

### Miscellaneous

[polyglot](https://github.com/MiguelPires/polyglot) is a programming language detector written in Python 2.7.

### Scripting

[wifi-password.pl](https://github.com/caramelomartins/wifi-password.pl) is a simple and fast way to get a WiFi password without having to go through Network settings or check the device. It was written in Perl so that I could get the basics of the language.

### Translation

[KeeWeb](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb) is a cross-platform password manager compatible with KeePass. I have helped with the translation of the application from English to Portuguese.
