Here is a list of some of the projects I have either created or worked on with other people. Also, there's a list of open source projects I have contributed to.

## Projects

- [awesome-linters](https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters) is a curation of the best linting tools available for several programming languages.
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/caramelomartins/dotfiles) are the .files, scripts and environment setup used in my Ubuntu machine.
- [Blocked](https://github.com/caramelomartins/Blocked) is a Python implementation of an Access Control application, for Educational Certificates, based on Hyperledger Sawtooth.
- [polyglot](https://github.com/MiguelPires/polyglot) is a programming language detector written in Python 2.7. I wrote this to fiddle with Python and understand more about it.
- [hugomartins.io](https://github.com/caramelomartins/website) is this website, a Hugo-based static website.
- [hackerrank](https://github.com/caramelomartins/hackerrank) is a collection of solutions that I submitted to HackerRank competitions or practice exercises. Mainly PHP, Python, Ruby and Shell scripts.
- [wifi-password.pl](https://github.com/caramelomartins/wifi-password.pl) is a simple and fast way to get a WiFi password without having to go through Network settings or check the device. It was written in Perl so that I could get the basics of the language.


## Contributions

- [CFDocs](https://cfdocs.org/) is a repository that holds documentation for the ColdFusion Markup Language. Since I had the need to learn the language I have contributed with some documents to the project. I did this because I used the website as a source of knowledge and wanted to give back.
- [Rocket.Chat.Docs](https://rocket.chat/docs/) is the documentation for the [Rocket.Chat's](https://rocket.chat/) API. While investigating their API I was able to contribute back a patch for the documentation website.
- [Nextclould Documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/) is the documentation for [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/). I contributed to this as part of my Hacktoberfest's participation, in 2017, with a couple of pull requests to fix some identified issues.
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) is a Python testing framework. I started using `pytest` for some of my Python projects and decided to contribute back by fixing up some identified problems in the documentation. I am currently a contributor and a member of the _pytest-dev_ team.
- [KeeWeb](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb) is a cross-platform password manager compatible with KeePass. I have helped with the translation of the application from English to Portuguese.
