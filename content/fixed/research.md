Studying to obtain my Master's in Information and Business Systems allowed me to perform some research, which I have presented as a Master's thesis. I focused on searching the interception between access control models, qualifications' verification and decentralized data sources to allowed for decentralized qualification's verification under improved and formally defined access control models.

During my research time, I built [Blocked](https://github.com/caramelomartins/Blocked), which is a proof-of-concept application built on top of [Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/sawtooth) for verifying educational qualifications, called *Educational Certificates*, on a decentralized blockchain. You can read more on the research on my Master's thesis below.

The main research interests I have are connected with the fields of my Master's thesis: Information Security, Access Control, Decentralized Applications. Particularly, how all of those overlap and how can we improve our existing engineering systems, in those areas, with new technology or new applications of older technology.

After I concluded my Master's thesis I have shifted my focus from academic research, diving more into open-source contributions, improving my understanding of the DevOps culture and operational applications of it, as well as understanding how to improve the reliability and security of systems, while maintaining flexibility and agility in software development.
