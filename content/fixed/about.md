I'm Hugo Martins, a Software and Infrastructure Engineer, Pythonista and soon-to-be Gopher, from Lisbon, Portugal.

I currently work as a **Site Reliability Engineer** for [Claranet](http://www.claranet.co.uk/). I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in Information and Business Systems. You can review some of my projects in the [Code](/code) and [Research](/research) sections.

I can be found online in several places. I usually code as [caramelomartins](https://github.com/caramelomartins), read as [Hugo Martins](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7832126-hugo-martins), watch movies or TV shows as [caramelomartins](https://trakt.tv/users/caramelomartins) or lurk on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=caramelomartins) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6461671). I also occasionally [take pictures](https://www.instagram.com/caramelo.martins/) of not-always-interesting things. Sometimes I write here too.
