I'm Hugo Martins, wannabe developer and maker of tools from Lisbon, Portugal.

I am currently a **Systems Developer** for [Claranet](http://www.claranet.co.uk/) and I am working towards my Master's degree in Information and Business Systems. I also seem to have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.

I have been working with computers since I was 14 years old and my first program was written in [Visual BASIC 5.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic) - it was a calculator. Unfortunately, I lost the code somewhere with the passing of time.

I can be found online in several places. I usually code as [caramelomartins](https://github.com/caramelomartins), read as [Hugo Martins](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7832126-hugo-martins), watch movies or TV shows as [caramelomartins](https://trakt.tv/users/caramelomartins) or lurk on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=caramelomartins) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6461671).

I also occasionally [take pictures](https://www.instagram.com/caramelo.martins/) of not-always-interesting things. Sometimes I write here too.

I am a young developer with an interest in **building tools** that expand the platforms with which people work to help them create more and better things.

Specially, Iâ€™m interested in joining my creativity to my engineering knowledge to **solve problems and automate tasks**.

You can review some of my projects in the [Code](/code) section.
