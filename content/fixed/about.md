I'm Hugo Martins, a software engineer and maker of tools from Lisbon, Portugal.

I am currently a **Systems Developer** for [Claranet](http://www.claranet.co.uk/). I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I am working towards my Master's degree in Information and Business Systems. Current research interests are access control, information security and blockchain-based technologies.

I have been working with computers since I was 14 years old and my first program was written in [Visual BASIC 5.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic) - it was a calculator. Unfortunately, I lost the code somewhere with the passing of time.

I can be found online in several places. I usually code as [caramelomartins](https://github.com/caramelomartins), read as [Hugo Martins](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7832126-hugo-martins), watch movies or TV shows as [caramelomartins](https://trakt.tv/users/caramelomartins) or lurk on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=caramelomartins) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6461671). I also occasionally [take pictures](https://www.instagram.com/caramelo.martins/) of not-always-interesting things. Sometimes I write here too.

You can review some of my projects in the [Code](/code) section.
