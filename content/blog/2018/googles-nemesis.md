An excellent article, [Google’s nemesis: meet the British couple who took on a giant, won... and cost it £2.1 billion](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/fine-google-competition-eu-shivaun-adam-raff), written by Rowland Manthorpe, in Wired:

> For the Raffs, this remains the burning issue, which the technicalities of auctions and algorithms all too often obscure. They see it simply: Google, or any other search engine, should present only impartial results that do not benefit it financially. It sounds idealistic, but why should it? “After all,” says Shivaun, “this is what people want, and what they believe Google still delivers.” This is the end the Raffs keep in sight: an internet in which search is neutral. And to get it they must keep stepping forward, again and again and again.

Just another account of the subtle, obscure and frightening power that companies like Google have.
