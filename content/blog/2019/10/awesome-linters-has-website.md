After years of maintaining [awesome-linters](https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters), with the help of [awesome people](https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters/graphs/contributors), having nowhere to point people to except for a Github repository, it finally has a website of its own - on a subdomain of this website.

You can visit its new home at [awesome-linters.hugomartins.io](https://awesome-linters.hugomartins.io/) - donâ€™t be shy.

**P.S.:** Congratulations to Github for improving the process so much. Updates for Github Pages, that are fed from `master` in a repository, occur automatically without any complex configuration.
