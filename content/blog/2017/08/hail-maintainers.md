This week I read an incredible article about [maintainers](https://aeon.co/essays/innovation-is-overvalued-maintenance-often-matters-more).This article is mostly focused towards infrastructure maintenance. It completely adapts itself to the current reality of software development.

The reality is that maintenance is not as shiny as innovation. But maintainers are, mostly, what keeps society, and code, working. If it weren’t for the software maintainers most of our software would already be broken, by now.

This excerpt, from the article, beautifully, explains what I feel about this:

> The most unappreciated and undervalued forms of technological labour are also the most ordinary: those who repair and maintain technologies that already exist, that were ‘innovated’ long ago.

Hail the maintainers!
